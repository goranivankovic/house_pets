                        Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth.
                         They are particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. 
                        Cats also enjoy acute hearing. All cats are nimble and agile,
                         and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.

                        When a dog gets a whiff of something new, he sniffs the odor into an amazing smelling machine. 
                        His nose has a special pocket called the olfactory recess that is separated from the rest of his nose by a thin bone.
                         He can store air in that recess while he continues to breathe in and out normally, which gives his brain more time to interpret the smell

                        In fact, there are 26 species of wild hamster that run free in parts of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, 
                        including Mesocricetus auratus, the Syrian hamster, which comes from the region surrounding Aleppo, Syria—the city currently under siege amid the Middle Eastern country’s ongoing war.

        <h1 class="text-success">About us</h1>
        Do you support local pet adoption organizations? Be the hub that connects pet lovers with pets who need a new forever home. You can create a text list that people can subscribe to that will send an SMS blast out every time there is a new pet in need of adoption. Here are some tips on how to manage that text list:

Segment your list based on what type of pets people are looking for. Survey those who sign up for the list and then create certain segments for cat lovers, dog lovers — you get the picture. You could even further segment your list by breed.
Send out an MMS message with a photo or even a video of the pet in question along with the important information on the pet.
Include a trackable link that will give people a way to get directly in touch with the adoption organization.
Playing a vital role in the pet community can help position your pet store as a go-to resource for anything pet related in your area.
